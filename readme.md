Project Summary
---
We will be looking into the store sales data from Corporacion Favorita[https://www.corporacionfavorita.com/en/], an Ecuadorian company with various sub-brand retailer chains under their commercial arm which provide grocery products to its consumers. This dataset comes from kaggle[https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/data], which is part of a kaggle competition.

The main objective of this project is to help the company to forecast sales between a certain period.

I will conduct EDA of the given dataset, creating visualization from the data as well as applying simple ML solution at the end to predict sales forecast for each catergory of the goods.
